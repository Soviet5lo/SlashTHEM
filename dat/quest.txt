%Cc Arc 00001
You are suddenly in familiar surroundings.  The buildings in the distance
appear to be those of your old alma mater, but something is wrong.  It looks
as if there has been a riot recently, or %H has
been under siege.

All of the windows are boarded up, and there are objects scattered around
the entrance.

Strange forbidding shapes seem to be moving in the distance.
%E
%Cp Arc 00002
Once again, you are back at %H.
%E
%Cp Arc 00003
You are back at %H.
You have an odd feeling this may be the last time you ever come here.
%E
%Cp Arc 00005
"Did you see Lash LaRue in 'Song of Old Wyoming' the other night?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00006
"Hey man, got any potions of hallucination for sale?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00007
"Did you see the artifact %l brought back from the last dig?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00008
"So what species do *you* think we evolved from?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00009
"So you're %ls prize pupil!  I don't know what he sees in you."
%E
%Cp Arc 00010
"Did you see Lash LaRue in 'Song of Old Wyoming' the other night?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00011
"Hey man, got any potions of hallucination for sale?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00012
"I guess you are guaranteed to make full professor now."
%E
%Cp Arc 00013
"So, what was worse, %n or your entrance exams?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00014
"%oC is impressive, but nothing like the bones I dug up!"
%E
%Cc Arc 00015
"Finally you have returned, %p.  You were always
my most promising student.  Allow me to see if you are ready for the
most difficult task of your career."
%E
%Cp Arc 00016
"Again, %p, you stand before me.
Let me see if you have gained experience in the interim."
%E
%Cp Arc 00017
"Once more, %p, you have returned from the field.
Are you finally ready for the task that must be accomplished?"
%E
%Cc Arc 00018
"%p, you have failed us.  All of my careful training has been in
vain.  Begone!  Your tenure at this college has been revoked!

"You are a disgrace to the profession!"
%E
%Cc Arc 00019
"%p, you are yet too inexperienced to undertake such a demanding
quest.  A mere %r could not possibly face the rigors demanded and
survive.  Go forth, and come here again when your adventures have further
taught you."
%E
%Cc Arc 00020
"%pC!  I've heard that you've been using sloppy techniques.  Your
results lately can hardly be called suitable for %ra!

"How could you have strayed from the %a path?  Go from here, and come
back only when you have purified yourself."
%E
%Cc Arc 00021
"Grave times have befallen the college, for %na has
stolen %o.  Without it, the board of directors of
the university will soon have no choice but to revoke our research grants.

"You must locate the entrance to %i.  Within it,
you will find %n.

"You must then defeat %n and return %o
to me.

"Only in this way will we be able to prevent the budget cuts that could
close this college.

"May the wisdom of %d be your guide."
%E
%Cp Arc 00025
"Beware, for %n is powerful and cunning."
%E
%Cp Arc 00026
"To locate the entrance to %i, you must pass
many traps."
%E
%Cp Arc 00027
"A %nt may be vulnerable to attacks by magical cold."
%E
%Cp Arc 00028
"Call upon %d when you encounter %n."
%E
%Cp Arc 00029
"You must destroy %n.  It will pursue you otherwise."
%E

"%oC is a mighty talisman.  With it you
can destroy %n."

"Remember not to stray from the true %a path."
%E
%Cp Arc 00034
"You may be able to sense %o when you are near."
%E
%Cc Arc 00035
A plain opens before you.  Beyond the plain lies a foreboding edifice.

You have the feeling that you will soon find the entrance to
%i.
%E
%Cp Arc 00036
Once again, you are near the entrance to %i.
%E
%Cc Arc 00040
A strange feeling washes over you, and you think back to things you
learned during the many lectures of %l.

You realize the feeling must be the presence of %o.
%E
%Cp Arc 00041
The familiar presence of %o is in the ether.
%E
%Cc Arc 00050
"So, %p, you think that you can succeed in recovering
%o, when your teacher, %l, has already failed.

"Come, try your best!  I shall destroy you, and gnaw on your bones."
%E
%Cc Arc 00051
"Again you try to best me, eh %p?  Well, you shall fail again.

"You shall never recover %o.

"I shall bear your soul to the Plane of Origins for my master's pleasure."
%E
%Cp Arc 00052
"You persist yet %p!  Good.  Now, you shall die!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00053
"I shall have %o from you, %p, then feast
upon your entrails!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00060
"Try your best, %p.  You cannot defeat me."
%E
%Cp Arc 00061
"I shall rend the flesh from your body whilst you still breathe!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00062
"First you, %p, then I shall destroy your mentor, %l."
%E
%Cp Arc 00063
"Tiring yet, %p?  I draw my power from my master and cannot
falter!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00064
"I shall rend thy soul from thy body and consume it!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00065
"You are far too %a -- it weakens you.  You shall die in this place."
%E
%Cp Arc 00066
"%d has forsaken you!  You are lost now!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00067
"A mere %r cannot hope to defeat me!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00068
"If you are the best %l can send, I have nothing to fear."
%E
%Cp Arc 00069
"Die %c!  I shall exhibit your carcass as a trophy."
%E
%Cc Arc 00070
The power of %o flows through your body!  You feel
as if you could now take on the Wizard of Yendor himself and win, but
you know you must return %o to %l.
%E
%Cp Arc 00080
The body of %n dissipates in a cloud of noxious fumes.
%E
%Cc Arc 00081
%lC touches %o briefly, gazes into it,
then smiles at you and says:

"Well done, %p.  You have defeated %n and
recovered %o.  But I fear that it shall never be safe
here.

Please take %o with you.  You, %p, can
guard it now far better than I.

May the blessings of %d follow you and guard you."
%E

%Cc Arc 00082
"Careful, %p!  %oC might break, and that would be
a tragic loss.  You are its keeper now, and the time has come to
resume your search for the Amulet.  %Z await your
return through the magic portal that brought you here."
%E
%Cc Arc 00090
"Welcome back, %p.  Have you progressed with your quest to
regain the Amulet of Yendor for %d?"
%E
%Cc Arc 00091
"Congratulations, %p.  I wondered if anyone could prevail against
the Wizard and the minions of Moloch.  Now, you must embark on one
final adventure.

"Take the Amulet, and find your way onto the astral plane.
There you must find the altar of %d and sacrifice the
Amulet on that altar to fulfill your destiny.

"Remember, your path now should always be upwards."
%E
%Cc Arc 00095
"You have betrayed all those who hold allegiance to %d, as you once did.
My allegiance to %d holds fast and I cannot condone or accept what you 
have done.

Leave this place.  You shall never set foot at %H again.
That which you seek is now lost forever, for without the Bell of Opening, 
you will never be able to enter the place where he who has the Amulet 
resides.

Go now!  You are banished from this place.
%E

%Cp Arc 00100
You receive a faint telepathic message from %l:
Your help is urgently needed at %H!
Look for a ...ic transporter.
You couldn't quite make out that last message.
%E
%Cp Arc 00101
You again sense %l pleading for help.

%Cp Arc 00102
"The silver bell which was hoarded by %n will be
essential in locating the Amulet of Yendor."

%Cc Lun 00001
Warily you scan your surroundings and sniff the air for signs of 
possible danger.  Off in the distance, you can see the familiar shapes
of %H.

But why, you think, would %l call you back?

Suddenly, you catch the scent of elves and other forest creatures ...
how could they be HERE?!

Without another thought you dash off towards the ruins that you 
call home...
%E
%Cp Lun 00002
Once again, you near %H.  You know that %l
will be waiting.

assault on us... wait... before I continue, I must see if you have
the potential to aid us"

%E
%Cp Lun 00016
"%p, you are back.  Are you ready YET?"
%E
%Cp Lun 00017
"Again, you stand before me, %p.  Surely you HAVE to be ready now!"

"*growl*  You have betrayed us, %p.  You will never attain
that for which you search!  Now begone from my sight, and be thankful
I let you live!

"Our forest is great need of your assistance, %p.

"About six months ago, I learned that the elves were banding together
with a human by the name of %n. At first, I paid it no 
mind, but then I heard reports of a huge army of 'forest folk' that was 
planning to invade our island.

"By now I had began to assemble my own army and ready my defenses. Then
disaster struck. While we were hunting for food one day, the elves 
attacked and stole %o from the ruins.

"We can not defeat %n while he has the %o. 
Find him, kill him, and return the %o to me. You will be 
rewarded greatly if you succeed.

"%nC is a powerful force, but no match for one of our kind!"

"If you fail, %p, we will have to abandon this forest."

everywhere!"

finally located %i.
%E
%Cp Lun 00036
Yet again you have a chance to infiltrate %i.
%E
%Cc Lun 00040
You sniff the air ... yes, the human is here. You would never mistake
that disgusting scent. Fortunately, they taste better than they smell.
%E
%Cp Lun 00041
Yet again you detect the presence of the human.
%E
%Cc Lun 00050
"So.  You have come for the staff. You shall never take it! So long as
I live it shall stay with me, your kind must be destroyed!

"By the powers of good!  Prepare to die, %c."
%E
%Cc Lun 00051
"So you have returned. Good... let's finish it this time!"
%E
%Cp Lun 00052
"You again? Don't you ever learn, %c! Are you prepared to be extinct now?"
%E
%Cp Lun 00053
"I must regain the %o! You will cause too much pain with it!

Suddenly, you see yourself at the surroundings of %H.
You smile as you recognize the land, remembering of the days you lived here,
learning the power of songs over nature, before you went on your voyages 
around the world.

But, wait... something is wrong.  The land looks desolated; the beautiful
river, which flow produced a soft music, now looks dead; the breeze,
once an inspiration to the music students, makes you shiver. The nymphs are
scattered and it seems all the muses abandoned the place. You feel something 
is wrong with the wild life here, too.  What happened to %H?

"What is that, %p? You had deviated from the paths of %d?

voice is heard:

"%lC sent one of his pupils instead of coming himself?

"You are indeed ready now, %p.  I shall tell you a tale of
great suffering among your people:

"Shortly after you left on your vision quest, the jungle was invaded by
the creatures sent against us by %n.

"She, herself, could not attack us due to her great size, but her minions
have harassed us ever since.  In the first attacks, many died, and the
minions of %n managed to steal %o.
They took it to %i and there, none of our
%g warriors have been able to go.  Worse, she has invoked its power
against us, and now conflict ravages our once-peaceful jungle.

"You must find %i, and within it wrest
%o from %n.  She guards it as
jealously as she guards all treasures she attains.  But with it,
we can make our jungle safe once more.  Without it, the spirit of the
jungle cries out in pain, and the animals are crazed and attack all
who pass near.

"Please, %p, recover %o for us, and return it here."

%Cc Cav 00035
You %x many large claw marks on the ground.  Your brief respite 
from the narrow jungle confines appears to be over... many paths lead
into the trees in all directions, and stagnant pools cover the ground.

Your nose detects the smell of carrion from somewhere deep within, and
unidentifiable, gnawed bones litter the nearby underbrush.

He takes it from your hands and does something you cannot see. You 
feel the very trees relax as the magic-induced hatred melts away from
the land.

He returns it to you and says:

    To prevent further trouble, I would like you, %p,

the Book of Skelos, I found this:

    %dC will cause a child to be sent into the world.  This child is to
    be made strong by trial of battle and magic, for %d has willed it so.

    The child of %d will take the Amulet, and travel to the Astral

"This is terrible, %p.  You have deviated from the true path!
You know that %d requires the most strident devotion of this

%E
%Cc Psi 00021
"Yes, %p.  You are truly ready now.  Attend to me and I shall

"During one of the Great Meditations a short time ago, %n and
a legion of elementals invaded %H.  Many %gP were
killed, including the one bearing %o.

Now, there are barely enough %gP left to keep the
elementals at bay.

"We need you to find %i, then, from there, travel
to %ns lair.  If you can manage to defeat %n
and return %o here, we can then drive off the
legions of elementals that slay our students.

"Go with %d as your guide, %p."

%Cp Psi 00036
Again, you stand before %i.

The stench of brimstone is all about you, and the elementals close in

Ahead, there is a small clearing amidst the bubbling pits of lava...
%E
%Cp Psi 00041
Again, you have invaded %ns domain.
%E
%Cc Psi 00050
"Ah, so %l has sent another %g to retrieve
%o.

"No, I see you are no %g.  Perhaps I shall have some fun today
after all.  Prepare to die, %r!  You shall never regain
%o."
%E

As you pick up %o, you feel the essence of

of Yendor.

"Go forth, and let %d guide your steps."
%E

"Only with the full support of %d can you succeed.
Go away, and don't return without the favor of %d."
%E
%Cc Nob 00021
"Yes, %r.  The cards say you are ready."

With that, she begins drawing cards from her deck. First is
the zero of trumps, followed swiftly by the queen and seven
of swords.

"After you departed from %H, %n 
and her companions broke into the keep and stole
%o, which symbolizes your right to rule
these lands."

The five of wands joins them on the table, followed by the
five of swords.

"With her stolen authority, %n raised
a peasant revolt and routed your army."

%lC gathers up the cards, suffles the deck, and
resumes drawing. Again, the first card is the zero of trumps,
this time followed by the three and seven of wands, the
queen and ten of swords, and finally the ten of trumps.

"You must travel to %i, slay %n,
and recover %o."

She sits back and fixes you with a piercing stare.

"I'd use the secret passage in your throne room to reach
the forest, if I were you."

%Cp Nob 00025

You feel you should hury back to the keep and take up your throne
once again, if just for a short time.
%E
%Cc Nob 00080
%nC sinks to her knees, coughing blood. She gasps:

    "Bastard. You may kill me, but you can't kill justice!
	The rebellion is greater than any one person. These people shall

the computer game "NetHack". 

With a sudden feeling of melancholy you remember the patches you

that this game is the best of all games known to mankind.

It is written in the Book of %d:

    After the Creation, the cruel god Moloch rebelled
    against the authority of %m the Creator.
    Moloch stole from %m the most powerful of all
    the artifacts of the gods, the Amulet of Yendor,
    and he hid it in the dark cavities of Gehennom, the
    Under World, where he now lurks, and bides his time.

Your %G %d seeks to possess the Amulet, and with it
to gain deserved ascendance over the other gods.

You, a newly escaped %r, have chosen to redeem
yourself by recovering the Amulet for %d.  You are
determined to recover the Amulet for your deity, or die
in the attempt.  Your hour of destiny has come.  For
the sake of us all:  Go bravely with %d!
