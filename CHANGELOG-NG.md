Version 0.9.6 (2021-09-14)
==========================
Smaller release, and wanted to do some racial changes before bumping this up, but bug reports and fixes from the community resolved some glaring issues.  A few changes made their way in as well.

#### Highlights
- Implemented the Less Boring Knights patch from Sporkhack
    - Knights can now be Chaotic (Human, Incantifier, Doppelganger, or Vampire) complete with their own role ranks, sacrifice gift and fountain dipping/crowning artifact.
    - The Magic Mirror of Merlin grants reflection if it's carried by Knights only; for all other roles it must be wielded instead.  In addition, it now grants Half Spell Damage when carried
    - Lances are no longer considered a polearm; they can no longer be 'a'pplied to pound a monster from afar.  The extra jousting damage formula has changed as well, going from 2d10 to 2d(5+level / 3).
    - Knight jumping burns less hunger (from rnd(25) to rnd(10))
    - Dragons are considered the natural enemy of Knights; they are always generated awake and hostile, and in addition can never be tamed by a Knight.
    - The Riding skill saw a few changes.  All roles that start with a steed (Knight, Warrior, Paladin, Yeoman, Noble) get a bonus to mounting their starting steeds allowing them to reliably use them at the start of the game.  However any character riding will not be able to use their steed's full speed until they've reached at least Skilled in Riding.
    - Knights saw a few skill changes: Can now reach Expert in Broadsword and Two-Handed Sword, however Mace and Javelin have been reduced to Basic.
    - Two new artifacts have been introduced for chaotic Knights:
        - Dirge: Chaotic Intelligent Short Sword.  +5 to-hit and 2x Poison Damage.  Grants Poison Resistance while wielded.  First Sacrifice gift for Dark Knights.
        - Soulthief: Chaotic Intelligent Long Sword.  +5 to-hit and +6 Damage + Draining.  Grants Drain Resistance while wielded.  Crowning/Fountain Dipping artifact for Dark Knights.
    - Chaotic knights do not get the Healing Hands or Turn Undead technique.  Instead they get a new tech: Souleater.  Requires the user to be wielding a weapon and be at above half of their max HP.  Upon use, inflicts half of your max HP as damage to yourself and reduces all non-flan (puddings, jellies and blobs) monsters in line of sight to 1/4th of their remaining HP (never below 1).  In addition, it increases the player's to-hit by +2 and all weapon damage by (level/4)d8 for (techleevel/2 + 1) turns.  If wielding Soulthief upon use the user gains an additional 4 turns for the extra damage effect.  Inspired by the Darkness/Souleater technique from Final Fantasy IV.

#### Other Changes
- Shallow water is now a finite resource when dipping objects into it (from Evilhack)
- Added newer missing attack types to the Datalog when farlooking a creature with EXTENDED_INFO defined in config.h (Issue #34 on Github)
- Slightly adjusted the spawn rates of the goodies in the chest in the Village (Good items 10% -> 5%, Bad items 20% -> 15%, one item in particular went from 20% to 10%)
- Added shallow water to some levels that originally contained some in the original patch (Barbarian, Healer, Knight, Samurai, Tourist and Wizard quests, some Medusa levels, Juiblex's Swamp)
- Randomized creator dieties in the intro text (from Unnethack)
- Candle light radius is now square root instead of logarithmically.
- Changed the Warrior deities from Elder Scrolls to Slavic.
- Multiple Shopkeeper wares crying tweaks (tl;dr, will bark wares more often, won't bark wares through doors/walls, slightly larger range)
    - Slightly increased the range that shopkeepers will bark their wares from
    - Black Market will no longer shout the "Bugger off" message if the player is wearing a striped shirt (as the player will never be banned from the black market by wearing one anyway)
    - Slightly increased the chance of shopkeepers barking their wares per turn (1/10 -> 1/7)
    - Shopkeepers will only bark their wares if they can see the player (prevents them from barking wares through walls and closed doors)
- Added a new artifact: The Pickpocket's Gloves.  Chaotic aligned Gauntlets of Dexterity, grants Searching and Stealth while worn.  Also increases the bonus for #borrowing from a monster by 20.
- Several Giant changes
    - Giants can use Two-Handed Weapons (except bows and crossbows) with one hand.
    - Giants can now properly two-weapon (this was intended previously, but because the giant monster didn't have two weapon attacks, never worked properly).
        - This change also allows all giants to have Two-Handed Combat as a racial skill.
- Reading a scroll of consecration while confused creates a toilet (an altar to the Porcelain God)
- Scroll of Clouds saw two changes
    - Reading a cursed scroll of clouds creates a poison cloud centered on the player
    - Reading a scroll of clouds while confused causes it to function as the scroll of air from Splicehack
        - Cursed sucks the air from your lunghs (does nothing if you're breathless)
        - Uncursed/Blessed creates a tornado around the player, pushing around creatures and clearing clouds from the area
- Necromancers digging into graves have a chance of automatically taming/pacifying the resulting zombie/mummy

#### Bugfixes
- Added a missing addtobill call in playersteal (Previously a player could steal from a shop by luring a pet inside, letting the pet pick up an object and #borrowing the object from the pet, as the game wouldn't recognize the item as being store owned still)

- Fixed bad logic in artifact.c that could lead to a panic (Issue #32 on Github)

Version 0.9.5 (2021-02-01)
==========================

#### Highlights
- Added the Beastmaster's Duster from dNethack as the sacrifice gift for Zookeepers.  Neutral aligned, +2 to AC, #invoke for Petmaster effect (opens a menu that allows creation of petfood, leashes, saddles, whistles, and can increase tameness of pets.  Liontamer is still in the game, but now isn't associated with any role.
- Added shallow pools of water from L's terrain patch/dNethack.  This also introduces a new Minetown variant: Creek Town.  Shallow pools can be generated in the dungeon, and may contain a few piranhas.  Walking through shallow pools can rust boots if they're made of metal.
- Added Nephi's Photography Patch.  Cameras will now create photographs that can be placed inside of a photo album.  (NOTE: This patch is not active by default.  Uncomment #define NEPHI_PHOTOGRAPHY in config.h and recompile to enable.)
- Gave the Rat King a new level to replace the old room-and-corridor layout.  It's very similar to Ruggo's old level, but with heavy amounts of water and shallow pools included.
- Added the Ornate Mace from Splicehack.  Only generated on throne room kings (see in changes below).  Same as the regular Mace, but a higher base value (500) and made of Gold.  Replaces the now removed Golden Saber.
- Carrying capacity changed to be mostly similar to vanilla.  Overall this results in a lower carrying capacity compared to previous versions, but a slightly higher carrying capacity compared to Vanilla.  The cap is still 4000, so having high strength and constitution will still give a benefit instead of having a cap of 1000.
- Added a new minetown variant: Ruined & Dangerous Town.  Empty temple, a couple of destroyed shops and plenty of boulders.
- Implemented most of the Less Boring Cavemen patch from Derek Ray.
- Implemented the Additional Item Categories Patch from Stanislav Traykov.
- Backported the #tip command from Nethack 3.6/Slashem 9.
- Ported over the #give command from Evilhack/Splicehack.
- Ported over the #terrain command from Slash'EM-Up.
- Renamed showobj_inv to menu_glyphs to be more consistent with other variants that include this.

#### Changes & Other Additions
- Flame/Ice/Electric/Acid mages gain a +1 bonus to charisma when wearing a Cornuthaum.  Wizards gain a +2 bonus instead.
- Removed two extremely difficult to navigate big rooms carried over from Slash'EM Extended.  Added a big room level that utilizes shallow water to compensate.
- Buffed War Hammers and Heavy Hammers.  Both are now two-handed and the Heavy Hammer had its weight increased (from 60 to 125), but War Hammers now do 2d6 damage to small monsters and 2d8 damage to large monsters.  Heavy Hammer does 2d8 and 2d10 instead.  (xNethack)
- Neutral sacrifices disappear in a cloud of smoke. (Nethack 3.7)
- Warriors, Pirates and Officers now start with a variable amount of their ammunition (Crossbow bolts and bullets).
